Last weekend, something truly special happened. A group of us — friends who studied together in Japan almost 20 years ago and have since spread out across the globe — finally came back to where it all began: Tokyo. But this time, it wasn’t just us. We brought along the greatest additions to our lives — our families.

Life has taken each of us on wildly different paths, but reconnecting reminded me of the power of enduring friendships. We laughed over stories from our student days, reminiscing about moments that felt like they happened yesterday. And yet, seeing how far we've all come — personally and professionally — was a testament to the unyielding ties that bind us.

This reunion made me reflect on how precious it is to nurture relationships. In an era of endless remote calls and online groups, staying connected is easier than ever, yet also too easy to take for granted. Meeting in person, sharing those memories and creating new ones, emphasized why we must value these bonds.
Here’s to friendships that grow with time, to taking the time to meet even when life feels overwhelmingly busy, and to always remembering the people who shaped a part of who you are.
