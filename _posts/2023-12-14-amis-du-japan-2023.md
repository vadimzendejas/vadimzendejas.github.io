Thank you to the Embassy of Japan in Luxembourg and to the ambassador Matsubara-san for the invitation and recognition as part of the "Amis du Japan" event last week. Good meeting many professionals supporting Japan economy and culture. Great conversations from AI to building a stronger Japanese community around technology, education and business.
