Many people is wondering what Generative AI and ChatGPT means for our work. I had a 
discussion with [Alexandru 
Pardutiu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandru-pardutiu-2579784/) 
on this topic and he shared with me this amazing 
article by [Benedict Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benedictevans/) on AI and 
Automation of Work. Very worth the read.

In the past we have seen technology innovations that have been helping us increase 
automation in our jobs, thanks to that innovation we have been able to optimize repetitive 
tasks, but without concerns for sure, trough history this has generated debate and 
uncertainty. But nevertheless, we have been evolving how we see work, what is important 
and we have been more focus on brining value.
