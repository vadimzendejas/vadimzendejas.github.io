This has been a very empowering and motivating week. The energy and passion that the Japan Global team has is helping our Japanese global customers to drive success and is at the core of the coming transformation and growth in our customer business! Big things ahead thanks to each one of you!
 
I am humbled to be working and partnering with one of the best teams ever! It was so exciting to see each of you during our Japan Global Connect in Tokyo and looking forward to continue partnering with you going forward.
 
Also, big thanks to Huma Zaidi and Juri Obuchi for helping to organize and all the teams around us who day to day support our business.
