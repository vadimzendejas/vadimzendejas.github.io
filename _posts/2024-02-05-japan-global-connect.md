Already two weeks since we kicked off our annual Japan Global Connect, and what an amazing week it was! Proud of all the hard work that went into organizing one of the best connects we've ever had. But most of all, I'm proud of the team that came together to accelerate our Japanese global business. It is a pleasure to work with one of the most talented and passionate teams in the world.

I like to reflect on the major accomplishments that the team is driving in one of the most complex businesses: with 180 countries covered, 16 time zones, and almost 1000 projects in the making, each of you makes it happen day after day!

Looking forward to a promising 2024! What a way to kick off the year.

Thank you Huma for the partnership. Juri we missed you, thanks for putting all together!
