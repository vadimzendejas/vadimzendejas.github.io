It was a pleasure and an honor to have participated and represented Microsoft in the Luxembourg Official Mission to Japan. I had the opportunity not only to accompany amazing leaders, entrepreneurs and officials to Japan, but to learn, connect and drive change for the success of the Luxembourg and Japan relationship. It was definitely a very successful week.

We visited several research institutes (AIST, NICT, NIMS) we learned from Fujitsu and NTT and the advances at the Fujitsu Technology Park and the Docomo Future Station visit. We participated in Tsukuba x Luxembourg startup night and saw a lot of potential on the new startups. We continued with a deep discussion on AI and Data Spaces and the future of data sharing between Japan and Europe. And concluded with a celebration of Luxembourg National day with the leadership of the H.R.H. Crown Prince of Luxembourg.

Thank you to the amazing organizers Na Shi-Bic and Georgia Margareta Kossmann and to the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce, Ministère de l'Économie - Luxembourg and the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, Defence, Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade 
for the invitation and organizing the Mission. 

The delegation will be headed by H.R.H. the Crown Prince of Luxembourg and led by H.E. the Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Xavier Bettel, Minister of the Economy Lex Delles, and Carlo Thelen, CEO of the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce.
