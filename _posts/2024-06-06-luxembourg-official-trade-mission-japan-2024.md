I am thrilled to share that I've been invited to join the Luxembourg Official Trade Mission to Japan 2024, representing Microsoft from June 10th to 14th. The agenda includes discussions on ICT, Cybersecurity, Health-tech, Space, and AI. Excited for the valuable conversations with Luxembourg and Europe partners and customers on the future of technology. Looking forward to strengthening the Luxembourg-Japan relationship and the success of the mission!

The delegation will be headed by H.R.H. the Crown Prince of Luxembourg and led by H.E. the Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Xavier Bettel, Minister of the Economy Lex Delles, and Carlo Thelen, CEO of the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce.
