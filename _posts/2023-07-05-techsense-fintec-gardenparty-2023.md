I had the amazing opportunity to attend [TechSense](https://techsense.lu/) Garden Party, I was glad to be together with [Sebastien 
Respaut](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srespaut/) representing our 
Microsoft business and very glad to meet amazing people in the FinTech space and the growing Tech community in Luxembourg.

I had the pleasure to have a very interesting discussion with [Mohamed Ourdane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-ourdane-7b22149/) on 
Cybersecurity and the new trends of technology.

Thank you [Haykel Ben Amara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haykel-benamara/) and [Younes 
Oumeziane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/younes-oumeziane-27b82b128/) 
for the invite, and thank you to all the people that shared their insights and for the new 
connections. It was also great to meet the NTT Ltd. team sponsoring the event and the discussions around the ongoing partnership with 
Microsoft.
