It has been a pleasure to participate in the reception for Building Sustainable Futures organized by the Japanese Embassy in Luxembourg and [Double Feather Partners](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dfp-tokyo/).

Very excited to meet and support very exciting Japanese startups focusing on sustainability to expand their solutions in Europe and Africa. It was a great pleasure to meet and greet young entrepreneurs with great ideas and to represent Microsoft on the community.

Thank you to Kohei Muto, Jekabs Vinauds and Japanese Ambassador to Luxembourg Matsubara-san for the invitation and organization, itâ€™s always a pleasure to be part of the Japan community and contribute to a sustainable future together.
