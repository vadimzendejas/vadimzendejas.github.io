It has been a pleasure to host the Microsoft Japan Global Connect this FY25. We had a very empowering week, we connected, we learned, we planned and we made new friendships. I am very excited and proud of all the team that came together to help accelerate and grow the Japanese global business.

This was one of the biggest events we hosted with all the Account, Azure, Modern Work and Security teams coming together with one common goal as OneMicrosoft! 

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Tim Schneider from Hitachi Energy and Gaurav Goel from NTT Data that joined us to share their experiences and best practices working with the Microsoft Japan team.

Thank you Yoshiko Fujimaki-san, TJ Shujiro Tajima-san, Akiko Muramatsu-san for the logistics coordination. Miki-san and James, thank you for helping us kick-off the event, Tetsuya Kobayashi-san for partnering with me on the opening. And everyone else who helped on the organization. 

Thanks to all the participants and guests for being engaged and for traveling all the way to Japan. See you all soon!
